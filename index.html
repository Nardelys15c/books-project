        Rock Paper Scissors
    </h3>
    <h4>by: Alice Feeney
    </h4>
    <p>
        Rock Paper Scissors was the first book I picked up in 2022. This mystery thriller was a great way to start. The book is about a couple who has won a trip away. Amelia hopes this trip will help their marriage. The only thing is that someone has been lying, and this will be the trip of a lifetime. I couldn't have picked a better book to start my reading journey. I have always loved mystery and thriller shows. It would help to read a genre I already like watching. It keeps me interested in the book. This book opened up the doors to my obsession.

        <h2>Lucy Score</h2>
        <p>
            Knox, a rugged barber with a wild beard and a rebellious spirit, lives his life much like he enjoys his coffee: solitary and straightforward. His only constant companion is Waylon, a loyal basset hound whose drooping ears and soulful eyes match Knox's no-nonsense demeanor. Preferring the quiet of his own company, Knox has little tolerance for chaos in his life. However, his world is turned upside down when a frantic runaway bride unexpectedly shows up.
