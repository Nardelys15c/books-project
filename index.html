        Rock Paper Scissors
    </h3>
    <h4>by: Alice Feeney
    </h4>
    <p>
        Rock Paper Scissors was the first book I picked up in 2022. This mystery thriller was a great way to start. The book is about a couple who has won a trip away. Amelia hopes this trip will help their marriage. The only thing is that someone has been lying, and this will be the trip of a lifetime. I couldn't have picked a better book to start my reading journey. I have always loved mystery and thriller shows. It would help to read a genre I already like watching. It keeps me interested in the book. This book opened up the doors to my obsession.

        <p>
        College student Joe Talbert has the modest goal of completing a writing assignment 
        for an English class. His task is to interview a stranger and write a brief biography of the 
        person. With deadlines looming, Joe heads to a nearby nursing home to find a willing
        subject. There he meets Carl Iverson, and soon nothing in Joe's life is ever the same. 
        Carl is a dying Vietnam veteran--and a convicted murderer. With only a few months to live,

        the crimes of rape and murder

        <p>
        Celaena Sardothien is her kingdomâ€™s most feared assassin. Though she works for the powerful 
        and ruthless Assassinâ€™s Guild, Celaena yields to no one and trusts only her fellow killer for 
        hire, Sam. When Celaena's scheming master, Arobynn Hamel, dispatches her on missions that take 
        her from remote islands to hostile deserts, she finds herself acting independently of his wishesâ€”and
         questioning her own allegiance.
