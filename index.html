        Rock Paper Scissors

    <p>
        Rock Paper Scissors was the first book I picked up in 2022. This mystery thriller was a great way to start. The book is about a couple who has won a trip away. Amelia hopes this trip will help their marriage. The only thing is that someone has been lying, and this will be the trip of a lifetime. I couldn't have picked a better book to start my reading journey. I have always loved mystery and thriller shows. It would help to read a genre I already like watching. It keeps me interested in the book. This book opened up the doors to my obsession.
